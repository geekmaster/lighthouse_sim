# lighthouse_sim
Project for testing Valve lighthouse algorithms. i.e. finding lighthouse given a tracked object and angular measurements.

I expect the code in this repo to develop into something that can be merged into cnlohr/libsurvive and/or mwturvey/DueLighthouse. 
Right now, this code also dumps out a pcd file that shows the point cloud of the various elements.  
To view the pcd file, go get a pointcloud viewer from http://pointclouds.org/downloads/
The binary you're looking for is pcd_viewer_debug.exe (at least on Windows).  
Note that to get the color to display properly, once the render is complete, press 'l' (lowercase L) then '5'
